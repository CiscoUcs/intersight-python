# SoftwarerepositoryFileServer

An external software repository which serves as the source of the file to be imported into the image catalog. If the source is the user's local machine, the file is copied/imported into Intersight's local repository. If not, only a pointer to the file in the external repository is created in the image catalog. For more information, please refer to the softwarerepositoryUploader and softwarerepositoryFile object descriptions where this type is used.
