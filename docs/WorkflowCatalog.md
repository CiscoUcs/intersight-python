# WorkflowCatalog

A catalog of workflow related objects such as workflow and task definitions. Each user account will have a local workflow catalog where account users can store their private workflow and task definitions. Cisco provides validated workflows and tasks to Intersight users via shared catalogs. Intersight users will be able to read, run these workflows and tasks within their account context. The shared catalogs will be managed entirely by Cisco. Contributions to shared catalogs will need to be provided to Cisco who will publish them at their own discretion.
