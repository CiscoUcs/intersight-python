from pprint import pprint
configuration = intersight.Configuration()
# Configure API key authorization: cookieAuth

### HTTP response details
| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
**200** | The HTTP 200 status response code indicates that the request has succeeded and the &#39;asset.DeviceContractInformation&#39; resource was modified as requested. The &#39;asset.DeviceContractInformation&#39; resource is modified before this response is sent back and the resource is returned in the body of the message.  |  * Set-Cookie -  <br>  * x-starship-traceid -  <br>  |
**202** | The HTTP 202 status response code indicates that the request has succeeded. The &#39;asset.DeviceContractInformation&#39; resource is asynchronously being modified as requested.  |  * Set-Cookie -  <br>  * x-starship-traceid -  <br>  |
**400** | The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without modifications.
