# PkixEcdsaKeySpec

The key pair is generated using Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), as defined in FIPS 186-4. The ECDSA standard was originally developed for the American National Standards Institute by the Accredited Standards Committee on Financial Services, X9. ANS X9.62 defines methods for digital signature generation and verification using ECDSA. Specifications for the generation of the domain parameters used during the generation and verification of digital signatures are also included in ANS X9.62.
