**200** | The HTTP 200 status response code indicates that the request has succeeded and the &#39;management.Interface&#39; resource was modified as requested. The &#39;management.Interface&#39; resource is modified before this response is sent back and the resource is returned in the body of the message.  |  * Set-Cookie -  <br>  * x-starship-traceid -  <br>  |
**202** | The HTTP 202 status response code indicates that the request has succeeded. The &#39;management.Interface&#39; resource is asynchronously being modified as requested.  |  * Set-Cookie -  <br>  * x-starship-traceid -  <br>  |
**400** | The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without modifications. For example, the request may contain an incorrect JSON syntax, or the request fails validation checks. The HTTP body may contain a document that provides more details about the error.  |  * x-starship-traceid -  <br>  |

If the request already included Authorization credentials, then the 401 response indicates that authorization has been refused for those credentials. The HTTP body may contain a document that provides more details about the error.  |  * x-starship-traceid -  <br>  |
**403** | The request was properly authenticated, but the server is refusing to fulfill it. The HTTP body may contain a document that provides more details about the error. For example, the user may not have sufficient privileges to perform the request.  |  * x-starship-traceid -  <br>  |
