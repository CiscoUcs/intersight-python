# CmrfCmRf

A reference to a REST resource from a complex type, uniquely identified by object type and Moid. CMRF is a short term workaround until MoRef properties of complex types can be supported. CMRF means complex type managed object reference and is unique enough that it can be removed easily later. The long term solution is to support for relationships stanza under complextypes. Deprecated.
